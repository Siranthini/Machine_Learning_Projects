This project applies machine learning techniques to analyze Cardiotocography (CTG) signals to predict fetal state and identify morphological patterns. 
We compare algorithms like Support Vector Machines, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting, addressing challenges 
such as class imbalance and feature selection.

Features
Analysis of CTG signals using various machine learning algorithms.
Detailed comparison of model performance.
5-fold cross-validation for model validation.

Technologies Used
Python
Machine Learning (scikit-learn, pandas, numpy)
Jupyter Notebook
